# JotForm Random Submission Generator

This project is random submission generator tool of JotForm. Sometimes we need to have multiple submissions with different random data on a form when we're testing / developing a feature. Using faker library to generate data and selecting what type of random data we need (name, email, address etc) for each question the form would be a nice feature.
